🔐 Controlled Keystroke Logging Simulation (Safe Environment)

📌 Project Overview

This project is a **controlled and ethical simulation** of a keylogging mechanism developed for academic and cybersecurity learning purposes.

The application captures keystrokes **only within a dedicated GUI window** and logs them locally with timestamps. It does NOT operate in stealth mode and does NOT capture system-wide keyboard input.

This project was built to understand how keystroke logging works from a defensive cybersecurity perspective.

🎯 Objectives

- Understand how keystroke capturing mechanisms function
- Demonstrate safe logging of keyboard events
- Explore potential risks associated with keylogging attacks
- Promote ethical cybersecurity practices

## ⚠️ Ethical Notice

This project is strictly for:

- Educational purposes
- Cybersecurity awareness
- Controlled lab environments

It does NOT:
- Capture system-wide input
- Run secretly in the background
- Transmit data externally

Unauthorized use of real keylogging software without consent is illegal in many jurisdictions.

## 🛡️ Security Awareness

Keylogging attacks can lead to:

- Credential theft
- Identity theft
- Financial fraud
- Corporate espionage

This project helps in understanding such threats in order to build better defensive strategies.
